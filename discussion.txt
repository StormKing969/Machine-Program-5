I tested the code the same way you did on the window1.txt and window2.txt

	First made the tutor.lnx
	Then I transferred it to the VM
	In the VM i did "mtip" followed by "~d"
	Then did "go 100100"
	Next, I switched to the remote VM to do the prompt after doing "spi on" on the VM
	Afterwards, I did "timeon 5" and "timeoff"
	Fianlly did the "spi off" and "~q" to exit the program 

I also played around when the prompt appeared

	Prompt: 
hello

	Prompt: 
world

	Prompt: 
how are you

	Prompt: 
my

	Prompt: 
name 

	Prompt: 
is Sajana



I found the "timeon 5" and "timeoff" commands to be intresting.
Especially when you try to type "timeoff" to stop the timer and it breaks into
"tim(5)", "eo(6)" and "ff(7)" 
Also the way how your input in the remote VM is sent to the VM
